        <h1>Welcome 😊</h1>
        <p>❤️ HELLO MY CUTIE PIE,<br>"I just want to take a moment to thank you for being with me these past two years in school. Having you by my side has been one of the most beautiful parts of my life. Together we’ve created so many unforgettable memories — from the laughter that echoed in the hallways, to the little adventures that only we will ever truly understand. Every day with you felt brighter, every moment more meaningful, and even the simplest things became special because you were there. You’ve given me joy, comfort, and countless reasons to smile, and I’ll always treasure the bond we’ve built. These two years weren’t just about school; they were about us, about the fun we had, the love we shared, and the way you made everything feel magical. Thank you for staying with me, for making me feel seen and cared for, and for turning ordinary days into memories I’ll carry forever. Ap ka bag chupana, Children's Day par sirf ap ko hi dekh te rehna, ap se ulte ulte baatein karna, ap se har cheez share karna, duty ka bahane pura school ghumna, classes bunk karna, Miss Nelam's office jana, Sir Naveed se jhoot keh kar bach jana, Ayesha ka sath mil kar ap ka mazak urana, ap ko girta hua dekhna, farewell par ap ka sath ghumna ap ka sath pics lena ap se baatein karna woh best day tha meri life ka, aur 14 August par school mein Habiba ka sath team up kar ke ap ko tang karna, sath mil kar bhand karna, ap ka sath mazak karna, aur bhi bahut kuch yaar bahut cheezein hain jo hum ne sath mein kari hain. Aur agar sach bataun yeh meri life ke best years hain yaar in ko zindagi bhar nahi bhool sakta main aur na hi bhool sakunga kabhi." ❤️</p>

        <h1>The Beginning</h1>
        <p>🤝 Remember when we first met? That day changed everything. Jab hum pehli baar mile the hum, aur hume koi idea bhi nahi tha ke hum dono itne ache dost ban jayenge aur ek dusre ke kareeb ho jayenge. Aur mujhe koi idea nahi tha ek ladki meri dost banegi lekin jo bhi bolo main aaj tak itne ache insaan nahi mila hun ga, u are the best meri Saliha jee, and I am very lucky to have u in my life and all that. Jab hamari baat shuru hui thi mujhe lagta tha ke main ap ka friend nahi ban sakta but main ne haar nahi mani main har qism ki koshish karta raha aur akhir mein ap ka acha wala dost ban hi gaya. Aur main dua karta hun ke hum hamesha sath rahen INSHALLAH. 🙏✨</p>
